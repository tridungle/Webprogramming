In this assignment, we added a new menu "ournews" which represents the layout of front-end that has multiple article groups 
because the design for menudrink products couldn't match this requirements
Also, we added comments and regular expressions to some of the sites to check validation.Admin can delete all comments while visitors can only delete their comments
We used regular expression and php function to prevent XSS attack.(as show on website's comments).
In addition, we added buttons to change themes when visitors visit the site 
we created a new button for css uploading or changing and images uploading in backend 
All delete will prompt a confirm box.
